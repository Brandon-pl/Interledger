# Interledger Hackathon 2024: 
SurePledge

SurePledge is a platform designed to provide transparency and ease in charitable giving, addressing the common concerns donors have when contributing through intermediaries. By eliminating these intermediaries, SurePledge ensures that donations are handled securely and transparently, from pledge to final donation.

Overview

Clients often feel uneasy when donating to charities through intermediaries due to a lack of transparency about how their contributions are managed and used. SurePledge addresses this concern by allowing users to make "pledges" — commitments to donate a specified amount to a chosen charity or charity category. When a user creates an account, they are prompted to share their interests by selecting three charities that are close to their hearts. Based on these preferences, SurePledge provides a diverse list of similar charities, enabling users to decide whether they want to spread their funds across multiple organizations or donate directly to specific charities.

Key Features

User-Centric Pledging: Users can create pledges for specific charities, with the flexibility to select charities that align with their interests.
Personalized Charity Recommendations: After selecting three preferred charities, users receive recommendations for other similar organizations, allowing them to diversify their giving.
Secure Pledge Storage: All pledges are securely stored in the TigerBeetle database, ensuring data integrity and safety.
Donation Scheduling: SurePledge notifies users when donation windows open, allowing them to fulfill their pledges at designated times. This approach ensures that users can commit to their donations when they are ready and able.
Advance Notifications: Users receive reminders of upcoming donation opportunities, giving them time to prepare and make informed decisions about their financial commitments.
Direct Transactions: When donations are open, users are prompted to fulfill their pledge by making the actual transaction or canceling it if they do not have sufficient funds. This process eliminates intermediaries, as the donation is transferred directly from the user's bank account to the designated charity’s account, ensuring a secure and transparent process from pledge to donation.
